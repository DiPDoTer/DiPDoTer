- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @DiPDoTer from Mississauga, Ontario, Canada
- Iâ€™m interested in vintage computing, grew-up on a diet of Z80s, 6502s, 6809s and 8088s! I compose electronic music whenever I get a spare minute.
- Iâ€™m currently learning electronics and PCB design and dabbling in some rudimentary emulation of my relay computer build.
